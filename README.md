# Multi-Class Classification Project: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Approaches

## Project Overview

This research project explores linear programming techniques for multi-class classification, focusing on both supervised and unsupervised learning methodologies. The project was conducted for the course ECE236A, offered by the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of California, Los Angeles.

## Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to develop comprehensive classification algorithms that can be applied across various datasets with different characteristics. The research encompasses four distinct tasks:

### Task 1: Supervised Learning - Linear Classification
- **Objective**: Develop a linear classification approach using complete label information
- Assumes full knowledge of training data labels
- Implements classification techniques for labeled datasets

### Task 2: Unsupervised Learning - Clustering
- **Objective**: Perform clustering without prior label information
- No access to dataset labels
- Implements clustering algorithms to identify data groupings

### Task 3: Advanced Learning Strategies
Two alternative problem approaches:
1. **Selective Labeling**
   - Work with a limited labeling budget
   - Develop an algorithm to strategically choose samples for labeling

2. **Feature Selection**
   - Operate with restricted feature set
   - Create an algorithm to identify and prioritize critical features

### Task 4: Comprehensive Analysis
- Analyze and discuss findings from previous tasks
- Provide insights into algorithm performance and limitations

## Key Requirements

- Algorithms must be adaptable to:
  - Any number of classes
  - Diverse dataset characteristics
- Detailed performance evaluation across multiple datasets
- Comprehensive visualization and reporting

## Datasets

Two distinct datasets were provided for comprehensive evaluation and comparative analysis.

## Methodology

The project employs a systematic approach to:
- Implement Linear Programming techniques
- Conduct rigorous performance analysis
- Visualize and interpret results
